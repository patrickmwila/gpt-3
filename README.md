## Introduction

Here I build a modern and responsive UI/UX design of GPT-3 website, following the [Javscript Mastery](https://www.jsmastery.pro/) [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMagNcngvcU).

I have acquired skills in:

- React Functional components and their reusability               
- React file and folder structure                                 
- Fundamental CSS properties to master flex & grid                
- Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model                               
- From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients          
- Perfectly placed media queries for responsiveness design
